#[NiiMante.com](http://www.niimante.com)

This is the repo for my personal website. As of now, the server is not configured on my EC2 instance, so navigating to [NiiMante.com](http://www.niimante.com) won't load anything! You'll be seeing a website soon though :)

More detail to come soon.

Configured this to work with git-hooks and EC2. More on this to come as well.

##Infrastructure

###MongoDB

I will persist blog posts, resumes, images on MongoDB.  Overkill I know, but I'm really eager to try out Mongo.

###Express

I'll be using [Express](http://expressjs.com) as a framework to make the use of Node even more simple.  

###NodeJS

I'll be using NodeJS to serve my web pages for fun. 

###AngularJS

I'll use AngularJS to make this a nice MVC style single page application with two-way databinding.  Obviously, Angular does way more than this, but these are the most important features to me.
